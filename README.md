# Paratrooper-chef

A capistrano recipe to execute chef-solo in each server.
All of you can use chef-solo remotely without chef-server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'capistrano-paratrooper-chef'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capistrano-paratrooper-chef

## Usage

This recipe will execute chef-solo through paratrooper:chef task.

To setup paratrooper-chef for your application, add following in you config/deploy.rb.

    # in "config/deploy.rb"
    require 'capistrano-paratrooper-chef'

And then, put your chef-kitchen files to config/ directory. 
by default, paratrooper-chef uses following files and directories.

* config/solo.rb
* config/cookbooks
* config/site-cookbooks
* config/roles
* config/data_bags

Finally, run capistrano with paratrooper:chef task. Then chef-solo runs at remote host.

    $ cap paratrooper:chef


## Setup chef-solo to remote hosts

Paratrooper-chef includes another task to setup chef-solo to remote hosts.
To enable it, add following in your config/deploy.rb.

    # in "config/deploy.rb"
    require "capistrano-paratrooper-chef/omnibus_install"

This recipe will install chef-solo using omnibus-installer during deploy:setup task.

Another way, you want to install chef-solo as gem package, use following lines.

    # in "config/deploy.rb"
    require "capistrano-paratrooper-chef/install"

This recipe will install chef-solo using gem command during deploy:setup task.
Of cource, capistrano-paratrooper-chef/install requires ruby and rubygems are available.

## Define attributes for specific host

Paratrooper-chef supports switching attributes for each host.
Put definition to config/nodes/#{hostname}.json.

If there are no defitions for host, paratrooper-chef uses config/solo.rb as attributes.

## Chef roles Auto discovery

Chef roles auto discovery appends roles of chef to run_list of each host.
To enable auto discovery, set :chef_roles_auto_discovery true (as defualt, it is disabled).

    # in "config/deploy.rb"
    set :chef_roles_auto_discovery, true

This feature makes name-based relations with role of capistrano and chef's one::
* Discovering role definitions of chef from role-names of capistrano that server is assigned
* Run chef with discovered roles at each server
* Be able to play different roles of chef for each server


For example, 'web.example.com' plays :web role:

    set :web, 'web.example.com'

And, there is role defition named 'web.json'.

    # config/roles/web.json
    {
      "nginx" : {
        # ...
      },
      "run_list" : [
        "recipe[nginx]",
      }
    }

Then, paratrooper-chef detects automatically these relation, and append 'role[web]' to run_list of web.example.com .
(do not effect to other hosts)
